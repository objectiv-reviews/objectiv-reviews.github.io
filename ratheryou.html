REVIEW BODDDDYYYYYY
-->

          <div class="reviews1">

<p class="letteredit">Ross dropping his 9th studio album. Ross's last few albums have not had much hype around them seems as though he's offering us the similar content he always has; I see the culture in recent years usually enjoying his projects for a couple of days then forgets about it. But it was different with this album there was a ton of hype right when it dropped. This is because ross has a true ear for production and beat selection; for the first few weeks people even calling it his best album yet. Though I really like this album I find myself picking it a apart.</p>

TRACK-LIST-REVIEW_____________________
-->

<div class="reviewsA">
<h1>1. Apple of My Eye</h1>
<p>Ross here is showing his love to the game he also briefly shares the advice he gave meek. Can't express how much I love this beat. Ross addressing a lot of things here, the messages are scattered. I love the Trump reference, the idea black people finally waking up coming together to start a revolution.</p>
</div>
<div class="reviewsA">
	<h1>2. Santorini Greece</h1>
	<p> Top 1 or 2 song off this album, clearly the fan faveorite and just has a super chill vibe. Ross starts off by telling how he was living when he was 15 selling drugs. He then dives into his lavish lifestyle now, with references to exotic locations and the expensive items he has. In the last verse he addresses racism and how white people love to see him buying flashy jewelry but hates on him when he's spending his money the smart way by purchasing real estate and assets that appreciate in value. </p>
</div>

<div class="reviewsA">
	<h1>3. Idols Become Rivals</h1>
	<p>Here we go, the meat and potatoes of this album, this track caught the most hype being as though Ross went at Birdman openly. Ross here defending Wayne because of the ongoing lawsuit against birdman. Birdman supposedly owes Lil Wayne over 50 million dollars and rappers like Tyga has never recieved a cent from Cash Money. So clearly theres some disloyal business going on. This beat is hard and fits the mood of the situation. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gI8JrMnG-_M">video</a> was ok, not as graphic as I thought it would be though.</p>
</div>


<div class="reviewsA">
	<h1>4. Trap Trap Trap</h1>
	<p>Tra Tra Tra Tra Tra Trash........  </p>
</div>

<div class="reviewsA">
	<h1>5. Dead Presidents</h1>
	<p>Real repetitive, lackluster Future had a good verse on here. </p>
</div>

<div class="reviewsA">
	<h1>6. She On My D*** </h1>
	<p>Hard beat, will get you hype but nothing to replay. </p>
</div>

<div class="reviewsA">
	<h1>7. I Think She Like Me</h1>
	<p> Usual Ross vibe, rapping about his lavish life and expensive material things. Also talking about some woman he's met in some exotic place thats def showing him signs.</p>
</div>

<div class="reviewsA">
	<h1>8. Powers That Be</h1>
	<p>Dope record, the Powers that be that Ross and Nas are referring too is pretty much the system set in place to keep minorities from prospering in life.</p>
</div>

<div class="reviewsA">
	<h1>9. Game Aint Based On Sympathy</h1>
	<p>Smooth jazz kind of record. Ross starts off speaking on early life when his fathers healthcare and pension was taken away and also living in project housing. He then goes into speaking on his rich lifestyle, and I love the shot at Stacey Dash.</p>
</div>

<div class="reviewsA">
	<h1>10. Scientology</h1>
	<p>Ross looking back to his past, friends, family and idols. He then outlines who was loyal to him and who wasn't.</p>
</div>

<div class="reviewsA">
	<h1>11. Lamborghini Doors</h1>
	<p>Dope record. Ross starts of by speaking on when he went to pick up Meek from jail which is a perfect way to introduce Meek on the track as you hear his vocals and jail bars closing. Meek on here speaking on his struggles in poverty compared to how he's living now. Anthony Hamilton's vocals on here compliment the record nicely.</p>
</div>

<div class="reviewsA">
	<h1>12. Triple Platinum</h1>
	<p>Ross went triple platinum when he sold 3 million copies of "God Forgives I Don't" in 2012. Ross doing more mediation and clearing things up with Drake and Meek. Ross throughout this record is speaking on his rise in lifestyle since going triple platinum.</p>
</div>

<div class="reviewsA">
	<h1>13. Maybach Music V</h1>
	<p>Ross here throwing an alley to Dej loaf, this this the perfect track for her. Dej is speaking of a past relationship in which she described as "Thug Passion". Ross on here describing the ride or die female he had who was loyal to him in every sense of the word. </p>
</div>

<div class="reviewsA">
	<h1>14. Summer Seventeen</h1>
	<p>Hype record, gives me that "I'm a Boss" feel. Ross here trying to level up and ensure his whole entourage is securing that bag this summer. Didn't really care for that Yo Gotti verse.</p>
