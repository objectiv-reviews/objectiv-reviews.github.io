REVIEW BODDDDYYYYYY
-->

          <div class="reviews1">

<p class="letteredit">Pusha T, cocaine cowboy and most lyrical act from G.O.O.D Music finally dropping this greatly anticipated project after 3 years of fans waiting. Push Throughout the album speaking in cryptic code to last generations drug pushers. This "album" is tight and compact with only 7 songs. Album is fully produced by Kanye West. After combing through these lyrics I must say Pusha t is heavily calculated in his moves.</p>
</div>
</section>

<div class="reviewsA">
<h1>1. If You Know You Know</h1>
<p>Pusha T here spitting that drug talk to the washed old heads in their mid 30s to 40s who used to push weight; with specific phrases only they could understand and relate to. Push not spelling everything out for the masses of people that wasn't connected to this culture hence "If You Know You Know". Push also aligning some differences in this generation of plugs and his era. </p>
</div>

<div class="reviewsA">
<h1>2. The Games We Play</h1>
<p>With No surprise Push is continuing the drug talk here on this track by describing the two completely different settings of the rawness of being in the trenches or bando cooking dope and on the other side living a beautiful lavish life of going to the club and running up the tab on bottles as well as just enjoying the fruits of his labor.</p>
</div>

<div class="reviewsA">
<h1>3. Hard Piano</h1>
<p>This title was cleverly named and describes the dope piano beat on this track as well as a drug reference with in the name. I'll leave that to the audience to figure out. Push and Ross speaking on the ups and downs of having much success in life. Push speaking on the #metoo movement which is responsible for the ruined legacy of many successful men today whether the allegations are true or not. </p>
</div>

<div class="reviewsA">
<h1>4.Come Back Baby</h1>
<p>To me this is the lull of the project, very skippable. Chorus sampled from George Jackson's "I can't Do Without You" the Chorus possibly detailing a drug user's internal feeling when fighting the addiction. Also Push once again showing love to the drug game.</p>
</div>


<div class="reviewsA">
<h1>5. Santeria</h1>
<p>If you search "Santeria" you will find that this is an Afro-Cuban religious cult. But as Pusha Explains in his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r5zFfUaSz0">Breakfast Club Interview</a> he says Santeria mirrors his emotions when finding out his road manager was murdered. In this track he also tells the tests that life brings you. Personally my faveorite track of the project with a beautiful eerie twig beat.</p>
</div>

<div class="reviewsA">
<h1>6. What Would Meek Do?</h1>
<p>Sheesh fire emoji* . Hardest beat on the project. Here Push is speaking on Meek Mill's injustice as he has dealt with the crooked judicial system and showing empathy, but throughout the entire first verse Push is double talking and lacing this verse with subliminal shots at Drake. Title is called "what would meek do" and Push mentions "Iam the hope, the dope dealers won" (Meaning Him and Meek Mill) have defeated Drake which he is predicting. Also in the verse he says "How do you respond? I let the Jewels and the hues talk" Jewels(Jewish) hues(color/ Black face). Drake is half Jewish and was recently exposed for wearing black face in a photo shoot. I feel like Pusha T was sitting on this information for some time and the title is actually short for "what would meek do with all the dirt I have on drake" and has predicted the outcome of winning the beef.</p>
</div>

<div class="reviewsA">
<h1>7. Infrared</h1>
<p>The track that has lit a fire back on the lyrical warfare between Push and Drake that has been going on for years now. Push setting a beam on Drakes head and mentioning Drake's ghostwriting allegations which is corny to me because he has already dealt with these allegations through writers credits and this is old news. Push also mentioned the birdman situation which is the meat and potatoes of this back and fourth, which he said "Now its okay to kill baby, niggas looked at me crazy like I really killed a baby". This was the realest bar on the track because Pusha's unpopular thoughts back 6 years ago have finally come into fruition as the masses agree but scolded him at the time. Push also calls drake a coon which Push later revealed of drake wearing black face.</p>
