REVIEW BODDDDYYYYYY
-->

          <div class="reviews1">
          
<p class="letteredit"> Big Sean following up with 'I DECIDED.' after dropping in my opinion his best project ever 'DARK SKY PARADISE', a couple years ago. When this album first dropped there wasn't much hype,  usually with these top tier MC's I'm waiting at midnight til it drops, but a couple days went by before I even took my first listen. All that aside this album is great and is definitley up there with 'MORE LIFE' AND 'DAMN'. </p>

TRACK-LIST-REVIEW_____________________
-->

<div class="reviewsA">
<h1>1. Intro</h1>
<p>Deep intro. This person is Sean in his past life speaking to God about how he has been doing the same thing all his life and has accomplished nothing only to realize this right before he dies by a car crash. The album represents Sean in his previous life and Sean now, you can even see this on the album art, the older Sean is on the right with the bald head lol. </p>
</div>

<div class="reviewsA">
<h1>2. Light</h1>
<p>  Old Sean is speaking on his inner power, inner Light that he had all along but didn't know. Instead he was spending his whole life looking elsewhere. He then goes in on the struggles of African Americans how the system stripped us from everything, our names, freedom and even our lives but they cannot take away anyones inner powers(Light). </p>
</div>

<div class="reviewsA">
<h1>3. Bounce Back</h1>
<p> Sean is channeling his underdog meantality on this one. He is measuring one's character and mentality by how they can come back from being in the red or taking a loss. Big Sean is fueling his grind by people sleeping on his music. A really motivating track to listen to, especially while working out or before a big game.  </p>
</div>

<div class="reviewsA">
<h1>4. No Favors</h1>
<p>I dont really care for this track, It has a great concept though. Sean and Em are on top of the rap game and never asked for "No Favors". Eminem's verse was everywhere and cringe as he said.  </p>
</div>

<div class="reviewsA">
<h1>5.Jump Out the Window</h1>
<p>From what I got from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SvVULpULkc">video</a>, Sean here is putting on his cape  and saving his girl or friend from a guy who's been abusing her physically and verbally.</p>
</div>

<div class="reviewsA">
<h1>6. Moves</h1>
<p>I like this track gets me hype. Obviously from the title he speaking on the moves hes making in the industry. Sean's flow is stupid on this track, he really spazzing. After listening to this I had to put him in my top 3 over J.Cole and Wale.  </p>
</div>

<div class="reviewsA">
<h1>7. Same Time, Pt.1</h1>
<p> I like this R&B  vibe. Jhene Aiko on here with the beautiful vocals. I feel like this is an interlude. </p>
</div>

<div class="reviewsA">
<h1>8. Owe Me</h1>
<p>On this track Sean is speaking on a wild ex of his thats always causing trouble. He was always going out of his way to please her but she never appreciated him and was a liability to the relationship never adding anything. She even going the limits of cheating on him. I feel like everyone can relate or has been down this road. </p>
</div>

<div class="reviewsA">
<h1>9. Halfway off the Balcony</h1>
<p>Big Sean here getting real personal and speaking on his suicidal thoughts. Maintaining in the rap game is hard mentally. The grind is draining, wears him down and makes him think of possibly ending it all.  </p>
</div>

<div class="reviewsA">
<h1>10. Voices in My Head/Stick To The Plan</h1>
<p> My personal fave from the album. Sean once again reflecting on his inner thoughts. In an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWthjEyE20o">interview</a> with the Breakfast Club Sean is saying these voices in his head are his demon holding himself accountable for his actions and if Sean is not going hard everyday, his demons will haunt him forever. The second part mirrors the first, he speaking on how to conduct one's  life on their path to success. Sean is going to keep working hard until his demons are gone and he has accomplished his goals.  </p>
</div>

<div class="reviewsA">
<h1>11. Sunday Morning Jetpack </h1>
<p> Sean here is feeling a bit nostalgic and reaminiscing of past memories of him and his family. He speaks on the life lessons his grandmom and mom taught him at certain points of his life.</p>
</div>
<div class="reviewsA">
<h1>12. Inspire Me</h1>
<p> On this track Big Sean is connecting with his mom, and how special she is. I think everyone can relate to this song with their mom being the most important person in their life and also being their inspiration. Whenever I hear this song I think of my mom then I think of Wanda Durant and how she is always there to support Kevin. </p>
</div>

<div class="reviewsA">
<h1>13. Sacrifices</h1>
<p>Song is dope, this track represents another element of Sean's work ethic. Sean knows that one has to sacrifice something to progress and be great in life. Time of which may be the most important thing to value in life, and Sean has sacrificed most of his personal time into his craft to be great. The Migos compliment this track perfectly, flow is crazy as usual.  </p>
</div>

<div class="reviewsA">
<h1>14. Bigger Than Me</h1>
<p>Before getting into the rap game Sean's motivation was the money, flashy cars, clothes and the women. But now that he has gotten everything that he wanted from the begining he still feels he hasn't pushed his career to it's full potential. Sean realized the rap game is bigger than him and is going to push his limits. </p>
