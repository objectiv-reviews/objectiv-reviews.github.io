REVIEW BODDDDYYYYYY

<div class="reviews1"><p class="letteredit">Its been a year and some change since this album first came out. At first listen I didn't really care for this album it seemed to be a bit 'EVERYWHERE' and a possible antic simliar to the previous project 'YEEZUS'. After a week or two I started to fall in love with it. Even more being as though it was a little bit of every Kanye album into one. Since this album has come out there has been a number of updates Kanye has made which can be off-setting although the one update I do love is last track 'Saint Pablo' which I have to say is my faveorite track off the album. </p>

<div class="reviewsA">
<h1>1. Ultralight Beam</h1>
<p> Beautiful intro, I really love this song a great gospel feel. Although I feel much more credit is due to Chance and that his presence was too much and he really took over the whole song. The Dream's vocals really were my favorite part of this track really setting the background tone. Kelly Price the choir where great and Kirk Franklin towards the end with prayer really made this track great and gave it integrity.</p>

<h1>9. I Love Kanye   </h1>
<p>There has been much speculation about the old Kanye dying when his mom died. He was once not as polarizing and was a nice guy, now he has become somewhat of a "Jackass" with his crazy antics for the media. The "old" Kanye's music was great giving us classic after classic, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy  is said to be the last of old Kanye. The content was uplifting and truthful. This has been the cultural consensus since he dropped YEEZUS which was not a fan faveorite and has had lots of backlash with it being vague and it's peculiar content. This 45 second poem "I love Kanye" is mirroring all of these opinions about him of his fans.  </p>

<h1>12. Real friends   </h1>
<p> On here Kanye is reflecting on the problems he has with his family and friends. This is a problem that most successful people have when they start getting wealth. Kanye is showing us how money can change the closest of people. Being the success that Ye is he's always busy, so he cant fulfill all of his plans with his family which can make his loved ones resent him. Family members constantly asking for money and distant relatives popping out of nowhere looking for a handout. Great concept. Ty Dolla $ign complimented this song perfectly, Its some real life stuff on here. Kanye cousin did him dirty. </p>

<div class="reviewsA"> 
<h1>17. No More Parties In LA</h1>
<p> Beat is hard. Kendrick spazzed on this. Kanye had a good verse too. Kanye and Kendrick are sick of the Hollywood lifestyle people and parties its becoming too fake to maintain. Kanye opens up with two lines speaking on the woman that he brought over from the previous night that had a spray tan and some cheap ray bans. Kendrick comes right in decribing the typical Hollywood party. Kendrick is seeing alot of girls from the country coming to LA to follow their dreams but also find an A-list celebrity preferably a rapper like these guys. Showing us how these girls lifestyles instantly change from having home cooked meals everyday and now eating whatevers open late night. From being around their family and people who love them to a toxic environment with drugs, phones, cameras flashing and shady managers trying to make a buck. Kanye steps back in telling us how he rolls to these parties always making a scene and showing up with the baddest females. He then paints a picture of how the fathers are the real problem. Being distant from the daughter is going to haunt the next generation of women. </p>

<h1>18. Facts</h1>
<p>Yeezy will never jump over jumpman but I like this song, he getting political. High energy. 
This is Kanye saying 'F*** YOU' to Nike, since his signing over to Adidas a few years ago and creating the Yeezy Boost. Kanye expressed an in an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOHhaMvk-XM">interview</a> with the Breakfast Club how Nike was holding him back and he was controlling little to nothing in the creative process. On this song he's just straight up attacking Nike and Jordan. Further saying that they would be nothing with the big endorsers like Drake or Lebron. </p>
</div>


<div class="reviewsA"> 
<h1>20. Saint Pablo </h1>
<p>Hardest song on this album! This was added to the album a few months after it dropped. Could have been some issues with clearing the Sample from Jay Z's "Where I'm From". But here Kanye is going into deep thought about his financial problems. He has said on twitter numerous times about how he's 53 million dollars in debt. Telling us his spending habits, interactions with his managers and how to not trust certain producers. He then goes into saying how mostly all African Americans struggle with their finances and prioritize poorly. I can really hear that old Ye. Sampha vocals are amazing. </p>
