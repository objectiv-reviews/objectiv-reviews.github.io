REVIEW BODDDDYYYYYY
-->

          <div class="reviews1">

<p class="letteredit">Drake coming back with his 8th project or album. This project was a bit everywhere for me probably why he has labeled it a playlist. Aubrey trolled us with the release of this project from the fall of 2016 and not even releasing it til late march in which created a lot of buzz around it. I like this project showing love to the U.K with features from Skepta and Giggs. Drakes gives us some tropical vibes as well as giving straight bars and sending shots at his peers.</p>
</div>
</section>

<div class="reviewsA">
<h1>1. Free Smoke</h1>
<p>Drake coming off straight ugly with this track giving that cocky attitude and sending shots at Jay and Meek. Drake really floats on this beat effortlessly. Listen closely to the flow around the 2:30 mark, it's seamless. Ghost writing line at the end is essentially a fatality to Meek Mill.</p>
</div>

<div class="reviewsA">
<h1>2. No Long Talk</h1>
<p>From what I seen, most didn't care for these U.K features and on the night of the release left twitter in shambles with memes and jokes on these features. Not a faveorite of mine, definitley a skippable track. </p>
</div>

<div class="reviewsA">
<h1>3. Passionfruit</h1>
<p>It's hard going from tough bar tracks like 'Free Smoke' to a soft tropical vibe like this but it is a "playlist" so you can't really complain. Great vibe, makes me want to eat mangos while barefoot or chill with a female.</p>
</div>

<div class="reviewsA">
<h1>4. Jorja Interlude </h1>
<p>Beautiful song. Very soft vocals from Jorja Smith. Light verse from Drake, complemented her well would like to hear more from the two together.</p>
</div>

<div class="reviewsA">
<h1>5. Get It Together</h1>
<p>Another tropical vibe featuring Black Coffee and Jorja Smith again. I love Drake on the hook but this is not a faveorite for me.</p>
</div>

<div class="reviewsA">
<h1>6. Madiba Riddim</h1>
<p>I love this Jamaican vibe, Drake is telling us his many relationships that have died at the cost of money and greed. Could be a possible shot at Meek, when he says he cant tell who his friends are. It would confuse me as well if I did a song with someone who I thought was my friend and then the next minute they are trying to expose me the next day.</p>
</div>

<div class="reviewsA">
	<h1>7. Blem</h1>
	<p>Drake continuing with his Caribbean vibes, this beat is dope. I don't think Drake was great on this track, I think Tory Lanez would body this though.</p>
</div>

<div class="reviewsA">
<h1>8. 4422</h1>
<p>Drake here throwing a lob to Sampha, who is the only person appearing on this track. I love his sound, Sampha is definitley one of the top Male vocalists today. </p>
</div>

<div class="reviewsA">
<h1>9. Gyalchester</h1>
<p>"Gyalchester" is in reference to the beautiful women in Manchester, Jamaica. Song is dope as hell. Drake on here really switching the topic every line, I like it though seems like a freestyle. Will get you hype in the morning. </p>
</div>

<div class="reviewsA">
<h1>10. Skepta Interlude</h1>
<p>Drake showing love to the U.K once again. Not something in my playlist but Skepta goes hard on this track. This is probably the smoothest track on the Album, Ive never heard somebody literally float on a beat like this.</p>
</div>

<div class="reviewsA">
<h1>11. Portland</h1>
<p>Something for the radio, not something I'd put in my playlist though, the whistle in the background annoying as hell. I like Drake's verse on here though Travis as well. Drake on here speaking on his success, Quavo on the hook speaking of other rappers riding his wave or taking his style. </p>
</div>
<div class="reviewsA">
<h1>12. Sacrifices</h1>
<p> This is pretty much a song about a female who supposedly got knocked up by Drake and Drake is denying all these allegations. Chilled out tropical vibe, some slick lines here and there Drake says the 21 line on the 00:21 mark of the song. I think 2 Chainz floated on this track. Young Thug really lost me half way through the verse</p>
</div>

<div class="reviewsA">
<h1>13. Nothings Into Somethings</h1>
<p>Drake here longing for a distant female of his past who has finally moved on and found love he is stuck wondering why she didn't wait for him.</p>
</div>

<div class="reviewsA">
<h1>14. Teenage Fever</h1>
<p>One of the better slow songs on this project sampling "If You Had My Love" by Jlo. Drake here is possibly just showing his love he had for Jlo in his teens he is also referring to the lustful feelings teenagers have when they think they are in love.</p>
</div>


<div class="reviewsA">
<h1>15. KMT</h1>
<p>This song is hard, in my top 5 off this project. Drake's verse is ok he seems to be chanting throughout the track. Giggs verse on here is flames he completely washed Drake. Giggs's batman bar is crazy, incorporating an onamonapia into a bar is insane. Best quotable out of the whole playlist.</p>
</div>

<div class="reviewsA">
<h1>16. Lose You</h1>
<p>Drake here gets back to giving us bars. This track is very intricate and layered. Throwing shots at Meek and Joe clear as day and dropping gems as well. Aubrey is also speaking to his friends and family and asking if they have turned on him.</p>
</div>


<div class="reviewsA">
<h1>17. Can't Have Everything</h1>
<p>Probably not one of the better songs on here but is very catchy I unwillingly bob my head to this track. QUOTABLE: "They tried to serve me up a cheese steak I gave em back a clean plate" . Drake continuing to slaughter Meek.</p>
</div>

<div class="reviewsA">
<h1>18. GLOW</h1>
<p>Dope song great duet. Drake and Kanye really competing with the vocals here to the point where they are actually yelling over eachother, Ye even says to turn up his vocals in the track. Other than that great song.</p>
</div>

<div class="reviewsA">
<h1>19. Since Way Back</h1>
<p>Not a fan of Drake and PND on the same record. Although they have a great flow together. Not something in my playlist.</p>
</div>


<div class="reviewsA">
<h1>20. Fake Love</h1>
<p>One of the singles Drake released right around when he was hinting this playist. Dope song and concept. Pretty self explanitory, Drake speaking on his friends and family showing him fake love which is worser than actual hate; I'm sure there are lots of crooked smiles in the industry as well.</p>
</div>

<div class="reviewsA">
<h1>21. Ice Melts</h1>
<p>Top 5 song off this playlist, a great collab with thugga in which he really stood out on this track vocally. I don't know if it's auto-tune or what but at the peak of the chorus his voice really hits new limit, could be the next Prince. </p>
</div>

<div class="reviewsA">
<h1>22. Do Not Disturb</h1>
<p>This might be the best track off this playlist and is comparable to "Lose You" considering the layered rapping display. Drake continuing to address his beefs and calls out Tory Lanez openly by his government (DAYSTAR) and called him a "6 God worshipper".</p>
