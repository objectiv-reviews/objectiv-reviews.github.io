REVIEW BODDDDYYYYYY

          <div class="reviews1">

<p class="letteredit">Jay Z coming with his "13th studio album" as it says in his album artwork. I would say which is one of the most important albums that he has released not only for him and his career but for black youth everywhere. Jay Z gets really vulnerable in this album and it's unusual being as though we've always seen him in the opposite light of being a boss that shows no emotion with arrogant tendencies but this project is truly a tell-all. I consider 4:44 the most important hip-hop album of 2017.</p>
</div>

<div class="reviewsA">
<h1>1. Kill Jay Z</h1>
<p>Jay Z opening with "Kill Jay Z", this is Jay attacking his own ego in which he is showing humility and being vulnerable. Hov throughout this song speaking on the various situations where he let his ego get the best of him by harming the people he loves over the simplest things. On here Jay also throws shots at Ye and Future in which sparked a lot of controversy considering Future's "baby mama drama", thus sparking a back and fourth between them.</p>
</div>

<div class="reviewsA">
<h1>2. The Story of O.J.</h1>
<p>Jay starts off in the chorus by naming any shade or kind of African American and bringing the community together destroying the labels and separations between them. This song is about black people actually having a plan in life, saving money and putting their money back in they're communities; simply gems of wealth sprinkled throughout this track. I love the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RM7lw0Ovzq0" target="_blank">video.</a></p>
</div>

<div class="reviewsA">
<h1>3. Smile</h1>
<p>Dope track, Hov looking back and reminiscing on the bad times in life and recognizing that those obstacles in life made him a better person. Jay here continuing with his honesty trend and starting this track off by speaking on his mom coming out of the closet and dealing with the stress of the shame in society. Jay's 3rd verse is ridiculous, might be top 5 verses of 2017. </p>
</div>



<div class="reviewsA">
<h1>4. Caught Their Eyes</h1>
<p>Jay coming together once again with Frank Ocean; pretty much routine now since he has been featured on Jay's past two albums. On this track Jay conveys the message of one  making sure to watch their surroundings. He goes on to speak on the struggles he has faced in harsh enivironments with people he can't trust. Hov emptys the clip on this track with 100 "eye" bars, lines or schemes.</p>
</div>

<div class="reviewsA">
<h1>5. 4:44</h1>
<p>This is the meat and potatoes of the album, a lot of sorrow in this 4 minute and 44 second song. Jay here is speaking to Beyonce and apologizing for his distrust and infidelities. Jay continuing to come to grips with reality and being honest. Hov has said he came up with the title because he woke up at 4:44AM and started writing for the album. Check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSkA61esq_c" target="_blank">video.</a> </p>
</div>


<div class="reviewsA">
<h1>6. Family Feud</h1>
<p>The perfect song to place next to 4:44, my personal faveorite from this album. Beautiful collaboration with Beyonce, her vocals are amazing. Jay here is speaking on the disconnect between the previous rap generations and the new class of rappers; the new school artists aren't doing their homework to pay the legends the proper respect they deserve and the old heads just flat out  don't understand that hip-hop is changing and there is a different climate now. </p>
</div>


<div class="reviewsA">
<h1>7. Bam</h1>
<p>Probably my least faveorite track off the project, beat is horrible. Throught this track Jay is telling the complete opposite message we heard on "Kill Jay-Z". Jay here getting back cocky and saying sometimes you need a big ego which is true. Also on here throwing shots at Kanye (again). Hov paying homage to Jamaiica by collabing with Damian Marley, he is also featured in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXXxUNJ23uk" target="_blank"> video.</a> </p>
</div>

<div class="reviewsA">
<h1>8. Moonlight</h1>
<p> This song is dope and super chill, I love the beat as well. Jay has been in the industry for almost 3 decades so he knows when things aren't moving forward. Jay is speaking on the rappers in the hip-hop industry making the culture stagnant; thus saying rappers are stck in "La La land". La La land is a play that was incorrectly named best picture at the Oscars hence the chorus "even when we win we gone lose". The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCSh48OlvMo" target="_blank">video</a> is inspired by the all black cast of the picture "Moonlight".</p>
</div>


<div class="reviewsA">
<h1>9. Marcy Me</h1>
<p>Jay here finally showing some nostalgia, and taking us back to when he was  growing up at Marcy houses in Brooklyn and hustling in those projects. Jay giving us a hint of the era by drawing parallels to NBA players that were prevalent during the 80's while he was bagging up pharmaceuticals. Dope song, might be the best display of rapping on this album.</p>
</div>


<div class="reviewsA">
<h1>10. Legacy</h1>
<p>Jay ending the album by speaking on the importance of generational wealth and shifting one's family tree. This song is beautiful because Jay saw that his family was poor but  he didn't get discouraged and worked hard so that every Carter after him does not have to worry about money. That's how you leave a legacy.</p>
